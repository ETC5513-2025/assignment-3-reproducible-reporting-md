### Recommendation

To accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, the following actions should be prioritized:

* Expand Renewable Energy Deployment – Fast-track solar, wind, and other renewable projects to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

* Modernize Grid Infrastructure – Upgrade power grids with smart technologies and large-scale battery storage to manage renewable energy variability.

* Strengthen Policy Support – Implement carbon pricing (taxes or cap-and-trade systems) and enhance incentives for clean energy research, development, and adoption.
